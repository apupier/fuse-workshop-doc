== Content Base Router with REST 

There is a REST endpoint, listening to receive payments. To make it more didact I'm using GET instead of POST.

Some samples of the use of this REST endpoint:

* http://localhost:8080/camel/orders/pay?paymentMethod=credit
* http://localhost:8080/camel/orders/pay?paymentMethod=cash
* http://localhost:8080/camel/orders/pay?paymentMethod=invalid

Open the class *ContentBaseRouter.java* to implement this lab. 

Process the *paymentMethod* query parameter as a header.

. when it is equal to *credit*.
.. Print "Processing credit payment..." as a log message in the console 
.. Set Message "[Credit Operation] Thank you for shopping with us" in the body 
. when it is equal to *cash*.
.. Print "Processing cash payment..." as a log message in the console 
.. Set Message "[Cash Operation] Thank you for shopping with us" in the body 
. Otherwise 
.. Print "Payment error" as a log message in the console
.. Payment error, try again choosing paymentMethod credit or cash

Check the answer below, try to do by yourself instead of just copy and paste.

    .choice()
        .when(header("paymentMethod").isEqualTo("credit"))
            .log("Processing credit payment...")
            .setBody(simple("[Credit Operation] Thanks for your purchased"))
        .when(header("paymentMethod").isEqualTo("cash"))
            .log("[Cash Operation] Processing debit payment...")
            .setBody(simple("[Cash Operation] Thanks for your purchased"))
    .otherwise()
        .log("Payment error")
        .setBody(simple("Payment error, try again choosing paymentMethod credit or cash"));

Congrats!

= 02 - Content Base Router

Using Content Base Router pattern to filter messages.

== Introduction

Content Base Router (CBR) is a pattern from the Enterprise Integration Pattern. You will use CBR when you need 
to filter some result, like conditional statements if and switch in languages like Java.

The code below is a CBR sample from the Enterprise Integration Pattern website

    from("direct:in")
      .choice()
        .when(header("type").isEqualTo("widget"))
          .to("direct:widget")
        .when(header("type").isEqualTo("gadget"))
          .to("direct:gadget")
        .otherwise()
          .to("direct:other")

You will use similar code in this lab. 

== Using CBR to separate different Books

Continuing to evolve the previous lab *hello-router*. We have 5 orders being generated automatically by the previous lab. 
In each order generated the item description is different, alternating between *ActiveMQ Book* and *Camel Book*.

Let's separate each of this different books with countent based router pattern. But first let's update the previous router to 
invoke the next router that we will build on this lab:

Add this line to the previous lab: 

    .to("direct:book-to-file");

Now, let's implement the content base router pattern:

    from("direct:book-to-file")
		.choice()
			.when(simple("${body.item} == 'Camel'"))
				.log("Processing a camel book")
			.otherwise()
				.log("Processing an activemq book");

We compare the *item* attribute of the object Order and print a message.

Run and check if both messages *Processing Camel book* and *Processing ActiveMQ book* appear in the log.

== Interacting with Files

https://camel.apache.org/file2.html

Let's use a new *File* component to persist this order on filesystem. *File* component is very powerful and enable us to 
interact with the file system easily. 

Adjust the router to persist the camel book in the directory */tmp/fuse-workshop/camel* and the activemq book in  */tmp/fuse-workshop/activemq*

    from("direct:book-to-file")
		.choice()
			.when(simple("${body.item} == 'Camel'"))
                .log("Processing a camel book")
                .convertBodyTo(String.class)
                .to("file:/tmp/fuse-workshop/camel")
			.otherwise()
                .log("Processing an activemq book")
                .convertBodyTo(String.class)
                .to("file:/tmp/fuse-workshop/activemq");

The line .convertBodyTo(String.class) is just invoking the Order.class to String method. and after we are saving all files in the filesystem.

Run and check if the directories has files inside and the content of the files.

But wait, look at file names is auto generated and very weird. Let's fix these exploring some parameters of the file component. 

Change the last line as the following:

Camel: 
    
    .to("file:/tmp/fuse-workshop/camel?fileName=camel-${date:now:yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmssSSS}.txt")

ActiveMQ 

    .to("file:/tmp/fuse-workshop/activemq?fileName=activemq-${date:now:yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmssSSS}.txt");

Run and check if the files have the names in the structured defined.

== Data Transform

https://camel.apache.org/data-format.html

Now, let's take the example before and instead of store everything in *.txt* format, let's tranform the Java object 
in camel body (Order.java). 

Let's transform the Camel type to JSON and the ActiveMQ to XML.

Basic to work with Data Format we have basic two methods, *marshall()* and *unmarshall()*. 

* *marshall()* we use to convert a Java Bean in other datype as xml,json,csv...
* *unmarshall()* we use to the oposite, when we have a datatype as xml,json,csv and would like to transform in a Java Bean. 

Let's remove the transformation of the body to String and do a properly transformation. To camel items let's transform to JSON and 
to ActiveMQ items to XML. 

Update the route to the following: 

    from("direct:book-to-file")
        .choice()
            .when(simple("${body.item} == 'Camel'"))
                .log("Processing a camel book")
                .marshal().json()
                .to("file:/tmp/fuse-workshop/camel?fileName=camel-${date:now:yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmssSSS}.json")
            .otherwise()
                .log("Processing an activemq book")
                .marshal().jacksonxml()
                .to("file:/tmp/fuse-workshop/activemq?fileName=activemq-${date:now:yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmssSSS}.xml");

Run and check if the files have the correct extensions and if the content is in in the format described.
